Vector Databases Documentation
1. Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to efficiently store and query high-dimensional vector data, often used in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and similarity search applications. This section introduces the concept of vector databases, their importance in enabling fast and scalable vector similarity searches, and typical use cases such as image and text retrieval, and recommendation systems.
2. Getting Started with Vector Databases

This guide provides a step-by-step introduction to working with vector databases, including setting up your first vector database, inserting and indexing vector data, and performing similarity searches. Through practical examples, learn the basics of vector storage, querying techniques, and how to integrate vector databases into your data pipeline.
3. Vector Database Architecture and Indexing Techniques

Understand the underlying architecture of vector databases and the indexing techniques they use to enable efficient similarity searches. This section dives into the algorithms and data structures, such as k-NN graph and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), that power vector databases, explaining how they work and their trade-offs.
4. Advanced Querying and Analytics with Vector Databases

Learn how to perform advanced querying and analytics with vector databases, including range queries, nearest neighbor searches, and combining vector searches with traditional SQL queries. Explore how to use vector databases for real-time analytics, personalization, and building AI-driven applications.
5. Best Practices for Scaling and Optimizing Vector Databases

Discover the best practices for scaling and optimizing vector databases to handle large datasets and high query volumes. This section covers topics such as tuning indexing parameters, choosing the right hardware, and strategies for distributed vector database deployments. Also, learn about monitoring and maintaining performance in production environments.
