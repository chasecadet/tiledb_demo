Distributed Frameworks
Introduction
Before we explore the Training Operator in-depth, we must justify its existence. The Training Operator exists because it vastly improves the operationalization of machine-learning frameworks that distribute code and simplify the model development lifecycle. To defend the training operator as a vital feature of Kubeflow (and a valuable use of your time to learn about), we argue that machine learning frameworks are necessary for ML teams, and thus, the improved operationalization is of great value.

This section aims to explain how teams benefit from machine-learning frameworks. We will:

Explore how one popular aspect of ML frameworks (running distributed code) is valuable to ML teams.
Investigate how machine-learning frameworks strengthen our model development lifecycle through specialized libraries, APIs, and development environments.

We will also discuss that ML frameworks don’t solve every potential ML problem independently, and teams must be flexible with their choice of frameworks. 

Why Distribute? 

In our previous chapter on Kubeflow Notebooks, we discussed why we need to distribute our machine-learning workloads across many clusters. We argued that reliability and performance improve our efficiency when training models and prevent us from wasting time. As a refresher, reliability is how resilient a system is to failures, performance refers to how fast or efficiently a system can complete a given task or set of functions under a specified workload, and scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth. Let’s discuss how the distribution of workloads across our resources supports these goals. 
Distributed Computing for Team Health and Wealth 
Distributed computing enhances reliability in machine learning (ML) systems by introducing redundancy and diversity in computing resources and locations. Distributed systems can continue operating even if one or more nodes fail by spreading data and computational tasks across multiple nodes or servers. This approach reduces the risk of system-wide downtime and data loss, ensuring ML applications remain available and consistent in their output. Reliability is valuable to our success as data professionals because we no longer worry about wasted time due to fragile workloads. 

Distributed computing significantly improves the performance of ML systems by parallelizing data processing and model training tasks. Large datasets can be divided and processed simultaneously across multiple nodes, drastically reducing the time required for data analysis and model training phases. Performance gains are especially notable when dealing with big data and complex, deep-learning models that require substantial computational power. Moreover, distributing workloads optimizes resource utilization, as tasks can be dynamically allocated to nodes based on their current load and computational capacity, ensuring efficient processing and minimizing bottlenecks. Performance supports quick feedback loops for our teams. Short feedback loops help us improve our innovation and project timelines due to an enhanced pace between iterations. 
Scalability is directly facilitated by a distributed architecture in ML systems. As the demand for processing power and data storage grows, distributed systems can scale out (horizontal scaling) by adding more nodes or scale up (vertical scaling) by enhancing the capabilities of existing nodes. This flexibility allows ML systems to adapt to increasing workloads and more sophisticated algorithms without significant reengineering. Cloud-based distributed computing environments further simplify scalability by offering on-demand resource allocation, enabling ML systems to dynamically adjust their capacity based on real-time demands, ensuring that the system's growth is both manageable and cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness benefits the team because the more expensive a model is to develop, the higher the organization's profitability demands for the ML project, and with 87% of ML projects failing, profitability is more important than ever for data teams.
In summary, reliability, scalability, and performance in systems help keep our projects profitable and our teams focused on more engaging tasks. Distribution helps satisfy these requirements through redundancy, the ability to allocate code to additional resources, parallel processing, and load balancing. 

We now understand the potential behind distributing our code, but what tools are available to improve our code's ability to scale and perform reliably? The answer is the Machine Learning Framework.
Why Machine Learning Frameworks?
Machine learning frameworks are essential tools that provide libraries, APIs, and development environments designed to facilitate the development, training, and deployment of machine learning models in reliable, scalable, and performant ways. Popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn offer varied capabilities ranging from deep learning to more traditional statistical modeling techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks for image tasks and recurrent neural networks for sequential data). 
These frameworks simplify complex tasks involved in machine learning, such as data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment, by providing high-level abstractions and pre-built components. They cater to a wide range of users, from researchers experimenting with cutting-edge algorithms to practitioners deploying scalable models in production environments. 
Differences in Distributing 
The choice of a machine learning framework often depends on specific project requirements, ease of use, community support, and the flexibility to customize and extend the framework to fit particular needs—making them a cornerstone of modern machine learning and data science workflow. Not all machine learning frameworks have identical or similar features. Teams must pick the proper framework for their problem, similar to how developers select programming languages.  Let’s explore this distributed disconnect further by examining the differences between Pytorch and SciKit-learn, as well as their abilities to distribute code across an environment. 

PyTorch (initially developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation) supports distributed computing and can utilize multiple machines to train deep learning models. Pytorch offers a specific module, torch.distributed, which enables parallelism across multiple processes and machines. This module provides a way to perform operations asynchronously and in parallel, effectively utilizing numerous CPUs and GPUs across different machines. 

Scikit-learn (a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language and a Google Summer of Code project by French data scientist David Cournapeau) is primarily designed for single-machine use, focusing on traditional machine learning algorithms rather than deep learning. While Scikit-learn can utilize multiple cores on a single machine via joblib for some algorithms (allowing parallelism at a smaller scale), it does not have built-in support for distributing computation across multiple machines in a cluster.
External libraries such as Dask can be used for tasks that require scaling out scikit-learn-style algorithms across multiple machines. Dask integrates well with Scikit-learn for parallel computing, enabling distributed data processing and model training across clusters of machines. However, this capability comes from Dask (or similar technologies) rather than scikit-learn.
In summary, PyTorch and Scikit-learn are popular machine learning frameworks, but they differ in their distribution capabilities and the range of features they offer. While PyTorch provides built-in support for distributed training, enabling models to be trained efficiently across multiple GPUs and nodes, Scikit-learn primarily focuses on single-node processing and lacks native support for distributed computing. Because of framework deltas, teams must be able to select the right tool for the job, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance to improve business and human outcomes. Still, before teams can expand their ML tool footprint, they must ensure they can manage all the essential and accidental complexity of running these tools in distributed environments. Kubernetes can help, but that help comes at a cost.
Complexity and Kubernetes
Introduction 
Machine-learning teams want to use machine-learning frameworks to create models to solve business problems, but those frameworks aren’t trivial to operationalize. Kubernetes simplified many aspects of machine learning framework lifecycle management but is no silver bullet. This section will:
 Define accidental vs. essential complexity to help us determine the boundary between critical problems that MLOp teams focus on
Address the role of an individual's perspective when determining these boundaries to understand the nature of these complexities and their subjectivity  
Use these newfound skills to explore the complexities within Kubernetes and how they pertain to ML teams
No Silver Bullet for Software: Accidental vs. Essential Complexity 

Let’s begin by describing the two types of complexity defined by the No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering paper by the Turing Award winner Fred Brooks in 1986. 

In this 1986 paper, Brooks distinguishes between two types of complexity: accidental and essential.

Accidental complexity relates to problems that engineers create and can fix. One example of accidental complexity is the authoring and maintenance of the microcode used to provision a volume on a storage array. Microcode refers to low-level software directly controlling the hardware, including storage devices.

Managing and authoring microcodes introduces unnecessary complexity for someone using storage space by adding extra steps and considerations outside of storing or accessing their data. This additional layer can make the storage system seem more complicated without offering clear benefits to a user focused on straightforward data storage and retrieval.

We demonstrated in a previous chapter that an end user can input their desired volume size, quality, and access mode via the Kubeflow Central Dashboard’s Volumes page and be granted a new volume. The user's request was decoupled from the underlying storage infrastructure's complexities. The microcode is responsible for executing fundamental operations within the hardware itself. When our user requests a volume, the microcode is still directed but is hidden from the end user. We could abstract away the microcode and storage complexity, making it seem accidental. 

Essential complexity, however, stems directly from the inherent difficulties of the problem we're trying to solve. Necessary complexity reflects the unavoidable challenges that must be faced regardless of the approach taken. Let’s revisit our volumes and microcode example. The microcode is a tool to solve the essentially complex problem of storing and accessing data on disks within a storage array. The microcode depends on low-level system architectures because it is an intermediary between the high-level machine instructions software uses and the hardware execution units within a processor. This complexity is relevant because we cannot store data on an array without it. If we cannot store data, we don’t have a way to collect and share information with others.  

We can take this further and argue language, in its essence, is a tool developed by humans to address the essential complexity of communication—transferring thoughts, information, and feelings from one individual to another. But just like how the languages we use and the cultures we are a part of shape our interactions with the world around us, the perspective of an individual defines a problem as essentially or accidentally complex.

Perspective Matters
Let’s unpack how perspective impacts a complexity’s category. If we revisit our microcode example, we determined that the microcode used to provision volumes was accidentally complex and has been abstracted away from the volume-requesting users by Kubeflow’s Volumes page. However, for individuals responsible for designing, implementing, or maintaining the storage systems, microarchitectures, and infrastructure that Kubeflow interacts with, the details of how storage is provisioned, including the microcode level, can shift from accidental complexity to essential complexity. 

Storage specialized professionals (firmware engineers, embedded systems engineers, and storage architects) require a deep understanding of the hardware and low-level software to ensure that the storage systems meet the performance, reliability, and scalability needs of the applications they intend to support. For machine learning teams, the storage supports machine learning frameworks and provides a place for applications to store datasets or logs. The frameworks and supporting machine learning applications are crucial systems that machine learning development teams must manage. Still, anything underneath them can be categorized as accidental complexity that must be abstracted.

The categorization of complexity is dependent on the viewpoint of the categorizer. Now that we understand this concept, you may think that Kubeflow has many moving parts and, therefore, can have different complexity categories based on your MLOPs persona. If so, you are correct!  Managing persona perspectives is one of the most challenging parts of MLOPs. One team's accidental complexity is another team's essential complexity, but by working together, we can create a unified solution that manages the vital complexity of the model development lifecycle.  Here is a 2022 Kubecon talk that explores persona perspectives and how to align ourselves better.

Now that we have explored complexity thoroughly, let’s touch on Kubernetes, an aspect of Kubeflow that introduces a lot of intricacy into our ML toolkit but can abstract away many of our accidental problems.  
The Complexity of Machine Learning Frameworks on Kubernetes (1)
Once Kubernetes was introduced to the world, teams could improve framework management to such a degree that when we were building this section, we had to dig to find old methods of TensorFlow deployments before Kubernetes. The questions we seek to answer now are: 
How did Kubernetes improve our model development outcomes?
How did the introduction of Kubernetes impact MLOPs teams? 

Before the introduction of Kubernetes, teams wishing to use TensorFlow would manually set it up on individual virtual machines (VMs) or physical servers. Configuring infrastructure involved manually configuring networking, installing dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across all nodes, and managing the starting and stopping of processes. Developers were responsible for ClusterSpecs for each TensorFlow deployment, consisting of a list of IP addresses and ports where different workers and parameter servers must be started. You can learn more about distributed TensorFlow before Kubernetes via this D2IQ blog post.

With the introduction of Kubernetes, teams could improve TensorFlow deployments by scheduling pod clusters and bootstrapping them together (i.e., configuring the ClusterSpec). Kubernetes alleviates the previous complexity hurdles by allowing teams to quickly iterate on TensorFlow deployments and configure them from a centralized location, dramatically improving ML workloads' operationalization, portability, and scalability. No more logging into various remote servers to install dependencies, configure traffic, add new workers, or fix other misconfigurations. 

Kubernetes lets us do things like:
Quickly redeploy newer versions of TensorFlow.
Upgrade previous TensorFlow runs.
Scale TensorFlow deployments.
Move TensorFlow deployments closer to data sources.
Pin workload dependencies.
Offload resource management from ML teams (i.e., volume provision, memory allocation, and GPU scheduling)

Continued on the next page.

The Complexity of Machine Learning Frameworks on Kubernetes (2)
ML teams can focus on the essential complexity of data-driven business problems instead of managing framework lifecycle and deployment patterns. Let’s inspect a Kubernetes Tensorflow deployment to understand better how this all worked.

 Below is the output of a kubectl describe command of a TensorFlow parameter server pod.

Continued on the next page.

The Complexity of Machine Learning Frameworks on Kubernetes (3)
Using Kubernetes, we improved the orchestration of TensorFlow jobs by:
Centralizing the configuration and orchestration of the TensorFlow framework
Configuring pods that can be clustered and scheduled across any node
Used services to ensure ingress and egress traffic
Registered our services with KubeDNS
Launched a TensorFlow job on the cluster

These tasks may seem like quality-of-life changes, but Kubernetes is still a very involved solution.  Working with Kubernetes means facing the inherent challenges of distributed systems, such as ensuring enough replicas, the pods are correctly configured, and the code is configured adequately within a pod’s containers.

 Beyond the Kubernetes resource configuration:
Kubernetes requires specific node configurations for things like port availability.
The Kubernetes nodes have operating systems that may need support
The Kubernetes nodes must be able to communicate with each other across the network
 Load balancers must be configured to handle ingress traffic

Managing all this infrastructure involves understanding the nature of systems spread across multiple machines. Solutions such as Kubeadm have abstracted away the deployment and management of core Kubernetes, but much of the complexity remains. For a historical view of the complexities of Kubernetes deployments, check out Kubernetes the Hard Way.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ML teams want to harness the power of ML frameworks. Kubernetes has dramatically improved its capacity to do so by improving operations through benefits such as centralized configurations and improved resource requests. Although abstracted, Kubernetes’ complexities are intrinsic to deploying and managing distributed applications at scale. They cannot be avoided but must be managed through well-designed abstractions, policies, and practices that Kubernetes and related technologies offer. The complexity of Kubernetes deployments is unfortunate for machine learning teams, which see all these Kubernetes-specific configurations as accidental complexity and Toil. In contrast, the ML framework selection is an essential complexity for model development.  

Luckily, they have the Kubeflow Training Operator to solve these problems.
The Kubeflow Training Operator and Supported Frameworks
Introduction
This section aims to help you better understand where the Training Operator fits into a machine-learning toolkit and enable you to discuss and describe the supported ML frameworks. 

In this section, we will
Explore how what was once seen as the essential complexity of ML framework management on Kubernetes can be abstracted away as accidental using the Kubeflow Training Operator
Discuss the frameworks the Kubeflow training operator supports and how they differ

The Kubeflow Training Operator’s Value Proposition
Brooks believed that there was no single answer to improving software. Still, he believed innovations focused on essential complexity could lead to significant improvements. 

The Kubeflow Training Operator takes the essential complexity of distributed system and framework management and transforms it into managed accidental complexity for MLOPs teams.

The Kubeflow Training Operator handles the complexity of machine learning framework job deployment without significant intervention from the machine learning team. Offloading the complexity of framework lifecycles allows teams to deploy training jobs via the custom resource definitions (specialized manifests that can be submitted to Kubernetes) or the Training Operator Python SDK.  

Once the job is submitted, The Kubeflow Training Operator will create the specific clustered framework within a series of pods, run the submitted training job, and free up the resources upon job completion. This process supports our goal of scalability. 


Revisiting our previous TensorFlow example, we showed you an output of kubectl commands that described a parameter server pod and listed the pods available within a namespace. We opted not to tell you that the TensorFlow job was submitted as a single manifest, which you can find here. Then, the services, pods, configurations, and other Kubernetes-oriented resources were all handled for us by the training operator. We can rapidly iterate and scale our jobs to improve our performance. The Kubernetes Controller Manager oversees all our desired replicas and works with the scheduler to handle failures, thus satisfying our reliability requirement. 
The operator pattern demonstrated by the Kubeflow Training Operator is why Kubernetes has been called the data center API. If we have an operator to handle the translating, we can use Kubernetes to translate manifests into API calls that configure any services with exposed APIs. 

Projects like Crossplane take this further, claiming you can use Kubernetes control loops to orchestrate APIs across any cloud environment or application if your Kubernetes has an operator or provider.
Kubeflow Operator Video

A demonstration can make visualizing the Training Operator in action easier to grasp, so we provided you with precisely that.

In this video, we will create an XGBoost job to train a distributed Iris classification model. We will use a Kubeflow Notebook to configure and start our two job types: a distributed training job and a prediction job to test our model’s performance.

XGBoost Training (XGBoostJob)
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an open source machine learning library widely recognized for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. It implements gradient-boosting algorithms and is well-suited for regression, classification (like our duck model), and ranking problems. Developed initially at the University of Washington, XGBoost has become a go-to tool for data scientists looking for fast, accurate, and scalable machine learning solutions.
The features that set XGBoost apart from other ML frameworks include the following:
Performance and Scalability: XGBoost is designed for speed and performance. It is optimized for both memory efficiency and computing power, making it faster than other implementations of gradient boosting.

Flexible: Users can define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria, adding a layer of flexibility that allows for a wide range of applications beyond standard regression and classification tasks.
Tree Pruning: Unlike traditional gradient boosting methods that stop splitting a tree when it encounters a negative loss, XGBoost uses a depth-first approach and prunes trees backward. This method results in more optimized and efficient trees. More details on how this works can be found at ”Unveiling Mathematics Behind XGBoost.” 
Built-in Cross-validation: XGBoost includes a cross-validation feature, eliminating the need for external libraries to perform this task, thereby simplifying the model validation process.

MPI Training (MPIJob)
Message Passing Interface Job (MPIJob) makes running allreduce-style distributed training on Kubernetes easy.  MPI is something that various frameworks and libraries can use rather than being a framework itself. It provides a set of specifications for message-passing, including data transfer, synchronization, and communication among processes running on different nodes within a supercomputer or a distributed computing environment.  

To put it simply, the official blog post states, 

“The MPI Operator leverages the network structure and collective communication algorithms so that users don’t have to worry about the right ratio between the number of workers and parameter servers to obtain the best performance. Users can focus on building out their model architectures without spending time on tuning the downstream infrastructure for distributed training.”

Key features that set MPI apart from other ML frameworks:
Distributed Computing: MPI facilitates communication between different processes in a distributed computing setup. Communication between other processes is crucial for scaling machine learning and data processing tasks across multiple machines, leading to more efficient computation for large datasets or complex models.
Parallel Processing: Many scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning tasks can benefit from parallel processing. MPI enables this by allowing processes to communicate and coordinate their work on different pieces of data simultaneously.
Scalability: MPI is designed to scale from a few to thousands of processors, making it suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This scalability is essential for frameworks that perform large-scale data analyses or train complex machine-learning models.
Interoperability with ML Frameworks: Some machine learning frameworks and libraries, especially those used in high-performance computing contexts, may use MPI to manage distributed computing tasks. For example, TensorFlow and PyTorch can be used in conjunction with MPI to distribute the training of deep learning models across multiple nodes.
Flexibility and Efficiency: MPI provides a high degree of control over node communication, which can lead to more efficient use of resources in a distributed system. This is particularly important for optimizing the performance of large-scale machine learning and computational tasks.

Conclusion
Machine learning frameworks are essential tools that provide libraries, APIs, and development environments designed to facilitate the development, training, and deployment of machine learning models. Frameworks can improve our ML workload reliability, scalability, and performance, but running these frameworks in a self-service and flexible manner is arduous without the orchestration power of Kubernetes. Yet Kubernetes is not a silver bullet. Kubernetes may improve framework agility and resiliency, but it also introduces a vast amount of additional complexity due to the nature of running distributed systems. The Kubeflow Training Operator takes what was once deemed essential complexity on Kubernetes and transforms it into accidental complexity by abstracting it. Now, teams can pick and choose from various machine learning frameworks, improving their ability to distribute their ML code and improving project reliability, scalability, and performance without the intervention of additional teams.
